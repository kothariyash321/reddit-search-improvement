# 📢 Reimagining Reddit Ads: A User-Centric Approach to Digital Monetization

> **A project for MGMT 682: Digital Product Design**  
> Team: Darshan | Dhairya | Maahi | Yash  
> 🎯 Focus: Transforming Reddit’s ad experience using user perception research, AI simulation, and strategic design

---

## 💡 Overview

This project proposes a **radically user-centered ad experience** on Reddit that balances:
- User satisfaction ✅  
- Monetization goals 💰  
- Privacy concerns 🔐  

Through a mixed-methods approach, including surveys, conjoint analysis, and A/B testing (simulated via GPT), we designed a **Three-Tier Ad Model** tailored to Reddit users’ actual needs and desires.

---

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Redefine ad engagement on Reddit using **user insights and data-driven strategies**
- Evaluate user **preferences around ads, rewards, and privacy**
- Propose a **flexible monetization ecosystem** to drive both revenue and satisfaction

## 🛠️ Methodology and Tools

| Step | Description | Tools |
|------|-------------|-------|
| 🧪 Survey Design | Developed Quantitative Survey & A/B Test Scenarios | Qualtrics |
| 🤖 AI Simulation | Used GPT to simulate proxy Reddit users for testing | OpenAI (ChatGPT) |
| 📊 Data Analysis | Conjoint analysis and quantitative segmentation | Excel, Python |
| 🎨 UI/UX Design | Subscription model prototype (3-tier) | Figma (or PPT mockups) |
| 📚 Documentation | Research findings & pitch presentation | PowerPoint |

---

## 🔍 Key Research Focus Areas

1. **Reddit Usage Patterns**  
2. **Ad Interaction Preferences**  
3. **Reward Motivations**  
4. **Privacy Trade-Offs**

---

## 📈 Insights from User Research

| Topic | Insight |
|-------|---------|
| **Top User Priority** | 39% prefer an ad-free experience |
| **Reward Preference** | 75% favor tangible rewards (coins, discounts) over privacy features |
| **Monetary Value** | 69% preferred $0.15/ad even with personalized targeting |
| **Ad Engagement Boost** | Rewards increased ad clicks by 10% |
| **Subscription Uptake** | Subscription interest doubled with tier-based options |

---

## 🔄 The Proposed 3-Tier Monetization Model

| Tier | Features |
|------|----------|
| 🟩 **Free Tier** | Traditional Reddit with minimal targeting and ads |
| 🟦 **Personalized Engagement Tier** | Opt-in targeting + reward incentives (R-Coins, Discounts) |
| 🟥 **Premium Privacy Tier** | Subscription-based, completely ad-free, max privacy |

> 🧠 _Users can dynamically toggle between tiers based on preferences._

---

## 🧪 A/B Testing with AI

- Simulated Reddit user behavior using **GPT as a proxy respondent**
- Identified **key motivators and blockers** for ad engagement
- Measured UI effectiveness and subscription likelihood

---

## 🤯 Unexpected Findings

- **Spam Concern**: Rewards ≠ tolerance for low-quality ads. Users still demand relevance.
- **Tangible > Abstract**: Rewards like discounts & coins are more effective than privacy assurances.
- **Tier Switching**: A flexible pricing selector improves adoption and satisfaction (UI scored 8/10).

---

## 🧭 The Road Ahead

- Pilot the **R-Coin ecosystem** and rewards framework
- Use **ML algorithms** to optimize ad targeting and reward personalization
- Test prototypes in small Reddit communities before broader rollout
- Use **A/B testing** continuously to refine ad formats and tier effectiveness

---

## 📌 Real-World Implications

| Stakeholder | Benefit |
|-------------|---------|
| **Users** | Empowered with choice and rewarded for engagement |
| **Reddit** | Monetization with reduced churn and increased satisfaction |
| **Advertisers** | Better engagement from users who actually want to see ads |
